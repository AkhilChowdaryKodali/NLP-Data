     Uses for Abciximab
    </h2>
    <h3>
     Acute Ischemic Complications of PCI
    </h3>
    <p>
     Adjunct to anticoagulant therapy (e.g., heparin [referring throughout this monograph to unfractionated heparin], low molecular weight heparin), aspirin, and a P2Y12 platelet adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-receptor antagonist (e.g., clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) to prevent acute cardiac ischemic complications in patients undergoing PCI or in patients with non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS; unstable angina or non-ST-segment-elevation MI [NSTEMI]) not responding to conventional medical therapy in whom PCI is planned within 24 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
     Adjunctive therapy with a GP IIb/IIIa-receptor inhibitor can reduce the incidence of cardiac ischemic events, including subsequent MI and death, in patients with NSTE ACS undergoing PCI and in patients without these conditions undergoing PCI.
    </p>
    <p>
     Safety and efficacy in patients not undergoing PCI not established.
    </p>
    <p>
     The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), AHA, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI), and other experts currently do not recommend
     <i>
      routine
     </i>
     use of GP IIb/IIIa-receptor inhibitors in patients with ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) undergoing PCI; however, selective use of these drugs as an adjunct to heparin may be reasonable in certain high-risk patients (e.g., those with large anterior MI and/or large thrombus).
    </p>
    <p>
     ACCF/AHA/SCAI state that administration of a GP IIb/IIIa-receptor inhibitor at the time of PCI as an adjunct to heparin may be particularly useful in patients with NSTE ACS who have high-risk features (e.g., elevated troponin) and are not receiving bivalirudin and are not adequately pretreated with clopidogrel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Regarding choice of GP IIb/IIIa-receptor inhibitor in patients undergoing PCI, IV abciximab, “double-bolus” IV eptifibatide, and high-dose tirofiban given by direct IV injection all produce a high degree of platelet inhibition and reduce ischemic complications.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Non-ST-Segment-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes
    </h3>
    <p>
     Has been used in patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI (i.e., NSTE ACS) managed with conservative medical therapy only
     <a href="#unlbl-use">
      †
     </a>
     ; however, manufacturer and some clinicians state that safety and efficacy of abciximab not established in such patients who are
     <i>
      not
     </i>
     undergoing PCI.
    </p>
    <p>
     A GP IIb/IIIa-receptor inhibitor may be used in conjunction with aspirin prior to diagnostic angiography (“upstream”) in patients with NSTE ACS in whom an initial invasive management strategy is planned; however, IV eptifibatide or tirofiban is the preferred GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor for this use. Abciximab is recommended in this situation only if there is no appreciable delay before angiography and PCI is likely to be performed.

     Adjunctive Antithrombotic Therapy: General Considerations
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       Used in conjunction with aspirin and heparin in clinical studies.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       Dosage of heparin required to maintain an appropriate activated clotting time (ACT) during concomitant therapy with abciximab may be lower than with heparin monotherapy.  (See Specific Drugs under Interactions.)

    <h4>
     Adjunctive Antithrombotic Therapy When Used to Prevent Acute Ischemic Complications of PCI
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       Aspirin: In clinical studies, patients received 325 mg 2 hours prior to PCI and daily thereafter.  ACCF/AHA/SCAI recommends that aspirin 325 mg be given prior to PCI in patients not already receiving maintenance aspirin therapy. Patients already receiving maintenance aspirin therapy should receive a dose of 81–325 mg before the procedure.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       P2Y12-receptor antagonist: A loading dose of clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor also is recommended prior to PCI in those undergoing stent placement.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       Heparin sodium: In clinical studies, patients received 70 units/kg if baseline ACT &lt;150 seconds, 50 units/kg if baseline ACT was 150–199 seconds, or no heparin if baseline ACT ≥200 seconds; additional injections of 20 units/kg were given to maintain an ACT of ≥200 seconds during the procedure. Experts suggest use of lower dosages of concomitant IV heparin sodium (e.g., 50–70 units/kg) given 6 hours prior to PCI and targeted to an ACT of ≥200 seconds.        (See Laboratory Monitoring under Cautions.) Postprocedural use of heparin generally not recommended.

     Warnings/Precautions
    </h3>
    <h4>
     Warnings
    </h4>
    <h5>
     Hematologic Effects
    </h5>
    <p>
     Risk of major bleeding (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage, genitourinary or GI bleeding, bleeding at arterial access site) and minor bleeding (e.g., spontaneous gross hematuria, spontaneous hematemesis); may require blood or platelet transfusions.    (See Bleeding Precautions and see Laboratory Monitoring under Cautions.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage reported rarely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Increased risk of major bleeding observed in patients weighing ≤75 kg;   during concomitant thrombolytic therapy; when PCI is performed within 12 hours of onset of symptoms of MI; following prolonged (&gt;70 minutes) PCI; or following failed PCI.
    </p>
    <p>
     If bleeding cannot be controlled by pressure, discontinue abciximab and concomitant heparin immediately.
    </p>
    <h4>
     Sensitivity Reactions
    </h4>
    <h5>
     Hypersensitivity Reactions
    </h5>
    <p>
     Possible anaphylaxis. If anaphylaxis occurs, discontinue abciximab immediately and initiate appropriate treatment; drugs for treatment of hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., epinephrine, dopamine, theophylline, antihistamines, corticosteroids) should be immediately available.
    </p>
    <p>
     Formation of human antichimeric antibody (HACA) reported.         Possible hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), thrombocytopenia, or diminished antithrombotic effect if abciximab is readministered or if monoclonal antibodies are administered in patients with HACA titers.
    </p>
    <h4>
     General Precautions
    </h4>
    <h5>
     Bleeding Precautions
    </h5>
    <p>
     To reduce risk of bleeding, adhere to strict anticoagulation guidelines; use a short course of low-dose, weight-adjusted heparin; avoid vascular and other trauma; carefully manage vascular (e.g., femoral artery) access site; and monitor all potential bleeding sites during and following treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Use caution in the placement, maintenance, and removal of vascular access sheath; avoid femoral
     <i>
      vein
     </i>
     sheath placement. When inserting sheath, puncture only anterior wall of femoral artery; avoid Seldinger (through and through) technique. Observe appropriate precautions while sheath is in place (e.g., complete bed rest, elevation of head ≤30°, restrain limb in which sheath is inserted, frequent monitoring of vascular access site and distal pulse in the involved limb). Following PCI, discontinue heparin immediately; remove arterial sheath within 6 hours following PCI (at least 2 hours after discontinuation of heparin) if aPTT ≤50 seconds or ACT ≤175 seconds. Following sheath removal, apply pressure to femoral artery for at least 30 minutes to achieve hemostasis. Measure and monitor hematomas for enlargement.
    </p>
    <p>
     To avoid vascular and other trauma, minimize arterial or venous punctures, IM injections, cutdown sites, and use of nasotracheal intubation, nasogastric tubes, urinary catheters, and automatic BP cuffs; avoid establishment of IV access at noncompressible sites (e.g., subclavian or jugular veins); consider using an indwelling venipuncture device (e.g., heparin lock) for drawing blood; document and monitor vascular puncture sites; and remove dressings gently and carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
     If emergency surgery is needed, discontinue abciximab.
    </p>
    <h5>
     Thrombocytopenia
    </h5>
    <p>
     Risk of thrombocytopenia. Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;20,000/mm
     <sup>
      3
     </sup>
     )   reported more frequently than with tirofiban.
    </p>
    <p>
     Determine platelet count prior to treatment, at 2–4 hours following initial IV injection, and at 24 hours following initiation of therapy or prior to discharge, whichever occurs first.  Consider possibility of pseudothrombocytopenia or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (in patients receiving concomitant heparin therapy).      Exclude pseudothrombocytopenia caused by an in vitro anticoagulant interaction by sampling blood in tubes containing edetate disodium (EDTA), citrate, or heparin. A low platelet count in the presence of EDTA but not in the presence of heparin and/or citrate supports of a diagnosis of pseudothrombocytopenia.
    </p>
    <p>
     If true thrombocytopenia is verified, discontinue abciximab and initiate appropriate treatment and monitoring. Platelet transfusions may partially restore platelet function.
    </p>
    <p>
     Possible increased incidence and severity of thrombocytopenia following readministration.
    </p>
    <p>
     Contraindicated in patients with platelet counts &lt;100,000/mm
     <sup>

     </sup>
     .
    </p>
    <h5>
     Laboratory Monitoring
    </h5>
    <p>
     Prior to administration, obtain platelet count, PT, ACT, and aPTT.
    </p>
    <p>
     Monitor platelet count during and after treatment. (See Thrombocytopenia under Cautions.)
    </p>
    <p>
     When abciximab is initiated 18–24 hours prior to PCI, maintain aPTT between 60–85 seconds. During PCI, maintain ACT ≥200 seconds.        If anticoagulation is continued following PCI, maintain aPTT between 55–75 seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Monitor aPTT or ACT prior to arterial sheath removal; do not remove sheath unless aPTT ≤50 seconds or ACT is 150–180 seconds (approximately 6 hours after PCI).
