      The effects of abobotulinumtoxinA and all botulinum toxin products may spread from the area of injection to produce symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults, particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms .

     Uses for abobotulinumtoxina
    </h2>
    <p>
     AbobotulinumtoxinA is used to treat the abnormal head position and neck pain that result from cervical dystonia (severe muscle spasms of the neck). Abobotulinumtoxina is also used cosmetically to improve the appearance of deep facial lines or wrinkles between the eyebrows (glabellar lines). It is also used to treat upper and lower limb spasms.
    </p>
    <p>
     AbobotulinumtoxinA is a botulinum toxin A product. It works on the nervous system to relax the muscles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Abobotulinumtoxina is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.
    </p>
    <h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">
     Before using abobotulinumtoxina
    </h2>
    <p>
     In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For abobotulinumtoxina, the following should be considered:
    </p>
    <h3>
     Allergies
    </h3>
    <p>
     Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to abobotulinumtoxina or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Pediatric
    </h3>
    <p>
     Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of abobotulinumtoxinA in children with
     <i>
      cervical dystonia
     </i>
     , and in children younger than 2 years of age with
     <i>
      lower limb spasms or upper limb spasms, including spasms caused by cerebral palsy
     </i>
     . Safety and efficacy have not been established.
    </p>
    <p>
     Use of abobotulinumtoxinA to treat
     <i>
      glabellar lines
     </i>
     is not recommended in children.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Geriatric
    </h3>
    <p>
     Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of abobotulinumtoxinA in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of abobotulinumtoxina than younger adults and are more likely to have falls, weakness, or side effects related to the eyes, which may require caution in patients receiving abobotulinumtoxinA for lower limb spasticity and glabellar lines.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Breastfeeding
    </h3>
    <p>
     There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Interactions with medicines
    </h3>
    <p>
     Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol
    </h3>
    <p>
     Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Other medical problems
    </h3>
    <p>
     The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of abobotulinumtoxina. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

     <li>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease) or

    </ul>
    <h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">
     Proper use of abobotulinumtoxina
    </h2>
    <p>
     Your doctor will give you abobotulinumtoxina in a medical facility. It is given as a shot into one of your muscles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Abobotulinumtoxina should come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Your doctor will only use abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport®) to treat your condition. Other botulinum toxin products may not work the same way and require a different dose. Tell your doctor if you have received botulinum toxin for any reason in the last 4 months.

     Precautions while using abobotulinumtoxina
    </h2>
    <p>
     <i>
      It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits
     </i>
     . This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to receive it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Abobotulinumtoxina may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis or serum sickness. These can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing or swallowing, fever, joint swelling, muscle aches, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after using abobotulinumtoxina.
    </p>
    <p>
     Serious muscle reactions have occurred within hours to weeks after receiving abobotulinumtoxina. If you start to have muscle weakness, loss of bladder control, or trouble with swallowing, talking, or breathing, call your doctor right away. In some patients, these problems could be life-threatening and may require immediate treatment in a medical facility.
    </p>
    <p>
     Abobotulinumtoxina may cause eye dryness when used in the treatment of glabellar lines. You may have reduced tear production, reduced blinking, and eye problems. Check with your doctor right away if eye pain or irritation, sensitivity of the eyes to sunlight, or other changes in vision occur during or after treatment. Your doctor may want your eyes be checked by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor).
    </p>
    <p>
     Abobotulinumtoxina may make your muscles weak and cause vision problems.
     <i>
      Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how abobotulinumtoxina affects you
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Abobotulinumtoxina is made from donated human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses to people who have received them, although the risk is low. Human donors and donated blood are both tested for viruses to keep the transmission risk low. Talk with your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
    </p>
