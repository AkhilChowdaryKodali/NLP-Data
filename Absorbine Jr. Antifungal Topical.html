     Uses for Absorbine Jr. Antifungal
    </h2>
    <p>
     Tolnaftate belongs to the group of medicines called antifungals. It is used to treat some types of fungus infections. It may also be used together with medicines taken by mouth for fungus infections.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tolnaftate is available without a prescription.
    </p>
    <h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">
     Before using Absorbine Jr. Antifungal
    </h2>
    <p>
     In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:
    </p>
    <h3>
     Allergies
    </h3>
    <p>
     Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Pediatric
    </h3>
    <p>
     Tolnaftate should not be used on children up to 2 years of age, unless otherwise directed by your doctor. Although there is no specific information comparing use of tolnaftate in children 2 years of age and older with use in other age groups, this medicine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children 2 years of age and older than it does in adults.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Geriatric
    </h3>
    <p>
     Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of tolnaftate in the elderly with use in other age groups.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Interactions with medicines
    </h3>
    <p>
     Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol
    </h3>
    <p>
     Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.
    </p>
