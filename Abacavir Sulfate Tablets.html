       WARNING: HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS
      </span>
      <span class="Bold">
       Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions, with multiple organ involvement, have occured with abacavir tablets.
       <br/>
       Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at higher risk of a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir; although, hypersensitivity reactions have occurred in patients who do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele
       <span class="Italics">
        [see Warnings and Precautions (
        <a href="#Section_5.1">
         5.1
        </a>
        )].
       </span>
       <br/>
       Abacavir tablets are contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and in HLA-B*5701-positive patients
       <span class="Italics">
        [see Contraindications (
        <a href="#Section_4">
         4
        </a>

        <a href="#Section_5.1">
         5.1
        </a>
        )].
       </span>
       All patients should be screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir tablets or reinitiation of therapy with abacavir tablets, unless patients have a previously documented HLA-B*5701 allele assessment. Discontinue abacavir tablets immediately if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status and even when other diagnoses are possible
       <span class="Italics">
        [see Contraindications (
        <a href="#Section_4">

         5.1
        </a>
        )].
       </span>
       <br/>
       Following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, NEVER restart abacavir tablet or any other abacavir-containing product because more severe symptoms, including death can occur within hours. Similar severe reactions have also occurred rarely following the reintroduction of abacavir-containing products in patients who have no history of abacavir hypersensitivity

     The recommended dosage of abacavir tablets in HIV-1-infected pediatric patients aged 3 months and older is 8 mg per kg orally twice daily or 16 mg per kg orally once-daily (up to a maximum of 600 mg daily) in combination with other antiretroviral agents.
     <br/>
     Abacavir tablet is also available as a scored tablet for HIV-1-infected pediatric patients weighing greater than or equal to 14 kg for whom a solid dosage form is appropriate. Before prescribing abacavir tablets, children should be assessed for the ability to swallow tablets. If a child is unable to reliably swallow abacavir tablets, the oral solution formulation should be prescribed. The recommended oral dosage of abacavir tablets for HIV-1-infected pediatric patients is presented in Table 1.

     The recommended dose of abacavir tablet in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) is 200 mg twice daily. To enable dose reduction, abacavir oral solution (10 mL twice daily) should be used for the treatment of these patients. The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been established in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment; therefore, abacavir tablet is contraindicated in these patients.

     Hypersensitivity Reactions
    </h3>
    <p class="First">
     Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir. These hypersensitivity reactions have included multi-organ failure and anaphylaxis and typically occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment with abacavir (median time to onset was 9 days); although abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during treatment
     <span class="Italics">
      [see Adverse Reactions (
      <a href="#Section_6.1">
       6.1
      </a>
      )].
     </span>
     Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at a higher risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions; although, patients who do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele have developed hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported in approximately 206 (8%) of 2,670 patients in 9 clinical trials with abacavir-containing products where HLA-B*5701 screening was not performed. The incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions in clinical trials was 1% when subjects carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele were excluded. In any patient treated with abacavir, the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction must remain the basis of clinical decision making.
     <br/>
     Due to the potential for severe, serious, and possibly fatal hypersensitivity reactions with abacavir:
     <br/>
     • All patients should be screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir or reinitiation of therapy with abacavir, unless patients have a previously documented HLA-B*5701 allele assessment.
     <br/>
     • Abacavir tablets are contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and in HLA-B*5701-positive patients.
     <br/>
     • Before starting abacavir tablets, review medical history for prior exposure to any abacavir-containing product. NEVER restart abacavir tablets or any other abacavir-containing product following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status.
     <br/>
     • To reduce the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status, discontinue abacavir immediately if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, even when other diagnoses are possible (e.g., acute onset respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, or influenza; gastroenteritis; or reactions to other medications).
     <br/>
     • If a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out, do not restart abacavir tablets or any other abacavir-containing products because more severe symptoms which may include life-threatening hypotension and death can occur within hours.
     <br/>
     • If a hypersensitivity reaction is ruled out, patients may restart abacavir. Rarely, patients who have stopped abacavir for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity have also experienced life-threatening reactions within hours of reinitiating abacavir therapy. Therefore, reintroduction of abacavir tablets or any other abacavir-containing product is recommended only if medical care can be readily accessed.
     <br/>
     • A Medication Guide and Warning Card that provide information about recognition of hypersensitivity reactions should be dispensed with each new prescription and refill.

     Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis
    </h3>
    <br/>
    <p class="First">
     Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including abavcavir. A majority of these cases have been in women. Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues. Treatment with abacavir should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity, which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations.

    <h3>
     Immune Reconstitution Syndrome
    </h3>
    <br/>
    <p class="First">
     Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including abacavir. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as
     <span class="Italics">
      Mycobacterium avium
     </span>
     infection, cytomegalovirus,
     <span class="Italics">
      Pneumocystis jirovecii
     </span>
     pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.
     <br/>
     Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves'disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
    </p>
    <a id="Section_5.7">
    </a>
    <h3>
     Myocardial Infarction
    </h3>
    <p class="First">
     Several prospective, observational, epidemiological studies have reported an association with the use of abacavir and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Meta-analyses of randomized, controlled, clinical trials have observed no excess risk of MI in abacavir-treated subjects as compared with control subjects. To date, there is no established biological mechanism to explain a potential increase in risk. In totality, the available data from the observational studies and from controlled clinical trials show inconsistency; therefore, evidence for a causal relationship between abacavir treatment and the risk of MI is inconclusive.
     <br/>
     As a precaution, the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including abacavir, and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).

     </span>
     These reactions have been characterized by 2 or more of the following signs or symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis). Almost all abacavir hypersensitivity reactions include fever and/or rash as part of the syndrome.
     <br/>
     Other signs and symptoms have included lethargy, headache, myalgia, edema, arthralgia, and paresthesia. Anaphylaxis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, myolysis, and death have occurred in association with these hypersensitivity reactions. Physical findings have included lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations), and maculopapular or urticarial rash (although some patients had other types of rashes and others did not have a rash). There were reports of erythema multiforme. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated liver chemistries, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, and lymphopenia, and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which were localized).

      Abacavir Once Daily Versus Abacavir Twice Daily (CNA30021):
     </span>
     Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as at least moderate) with a greater than or equal to 5% frequency during therapy with abacavir 600 mg once daily or abacavir 300 mg twice daily both in combination with lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily from CNA30021, were similar. For hypersensitivity reactions, subjects receiving abacavir once daily showed a rate of 9% in comparison with a rate of 7% for subjects receiving abacavir twice daily. However, subjects receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily experienced a significantly higher incidence of severe drug hypersensitivity reactions and severe diarrhea compared with subjects who received abacavir 300 mg twice daily. Five percent (5%) of subjects receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily had severe drug hypersensitivity reactions compared with 2% of subjects receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily. Two percent (2%) of subjects receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily had severe diarrhea while none of the subjects receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily had this event.

     The safety of once-daily compared with twice-daily dosing of abacavir was assessed in the ARROW trial. Primary safety assessment in the ARROW trial was based on Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events. The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events was similar among subjects randomized to once-daily dosing compared with subjects randomized to twice-daily dosing. One event of Grade 4 hepatitis in the once-daily cohort was considered as uncertain causality by the investigator and all other Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were considered not related by the investigator.

     Available data from the APR show no difference in the overall risk of birth defects for abacavir compared with the background rate for major birth defects of 2.7% in the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) reference population
     <span class="Italics">
      (see Data).
     </span>
     The APR uses the MACDP as the U.S. reference population for birth defects in the general population. The MACDP evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at less than 20 weeks'gestation. The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR. The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U.S. general population is 15% to 20%. The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

     In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of abacavir to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in fetal malformations and other embryonic and fetal toxicities at exposures 35 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical daily dose.

     Based on prospective reports to the APR of over 2,000 exposures to abacavir during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 1,000 exposed in the first trimester), there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for abacavir compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of defects in live births was 2.9% (95% CI: 2.0% to 4.1%) following first trimester exposure to abacavir-containing regimens and 2.7% (95% CI: 1.9% to 3.7%) following second/third trimester exposure to abacavir-containing regimens.

Fetal malformations (increased incidences of fetal anasarca and skeletal malformations) or developmental toxicity (decreased fetal body weight and crown-rump length) were observed in rats at doses up to 1,000 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures approximately 35 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended daily dose. No developmental effects were observed in rats at 100 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures (AUC) 3.5 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose. In a fertility and early embryo-fetal development study conducted in rats (at 60, 160, or 500 mg per kg per day), embryonic and fetal toxicities (increased resorptions, decreased fetal body weights) or toxicities to the offspring (increased incidence of stillbirth and lower body weights) occurred at doses up to 500 mg per kg per day. No developmental effects were observed in rats at 60 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures (AUC) approximately 4 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Studies in pregnant rats showed that abacavir is transferred to the fetus through the placenta. In pregnant rabbits, no developmental toxicities and no increases in fetal malformations occurred at up to the highest dose evaluated, resulting in exposures (AUC) approximately 9 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.

      Risk Summary

     <br/>
     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-1-infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. Abacavir is present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of abacavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for (1) HIV-1 transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and (3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving abacavir tablets.

     </span>
     <br/>
     The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir were independent of dose over the range of 300 to 1,200 mg per day.
     <br/>
     <span class="Italics">
      Absorption and Bioavailability:
     </span>
     Following oral administration, abacavir is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed. The geometric mean absolute bioavailability of the tablet was 83%. Plasma abacavir AUC was similar following administration of the oral solution or tablets. After oral administration of 300 mg twice daily in 20 subjects, the steady-state peak serum abacavir concentration (C
     <span class="Sub">
      max
     </span>
     ) was 3 ± 0.89 mcg per mL (mean ± SD) and AUC
     <span class="Sub">
      (0 to 12 h)
     </span>
     was 6.02 ± 1.73 mcg•hour per mL. After oral administration of a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir in 20 subjects, C
     <span class="Sub">
      max
     </span>
     was 4.26 ± 1.19 mcg per mL (mean ± SD) and AUC
     <span class="Sub">
      ∞
     </span>
     was 11.95 ± 2.51 mcg•hour per mL.
     <br/>
     <span class="Italics">
      Distribution:
     </span>
     The apparent volume of distribution after IV administration of abacavir was 0.86 ± 0.15 L per kg, suggesting that abacavir distributes into extravascular space. In 3 subjects, the CSF AUC
     <span class="Sub">
      (0 to 6 h)
     </span>
     to plasma abacavir AUC
     <span class="Sub">
      (0 to 6 h)
     </span>
     ratio ranged from 27% to 33%.
     <br/>
     Binding of abacavir to human plasma proteins is approximately 50% and was independent of concentration. Total blood and plasma drug-related radioactivity concentrations are identical, demonstrating that abacavir readily distributes into erythrocytes.
     <br/>
     <span class="Italics">
      Elimination:
     </span>
     In single-dose trails, the observed elimination half-life (t
     <span class="Sub">
      1/2
     </span>
     ) was 1.54 ± 0.63 hours. After intravenous administration, total clearance was 0.80 ± 0.24 L per hour per kg (mean ± SD).
     <br/>
     <span class="Italics">
      Metabolism :
     </span>
     In humans, abacavir is not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The primary routes of elimination of abacavir are metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase to form the 5'-carboxylic acid and glucuronyl transferase to form the 5'-glucuronide. The metabolites do not have antiviral activity.
     <span class="Italics">
      In vitro
     </span>
     experiments reveal that abacavir does not inhibit human CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity at clinically relevant concentrations.
     <br/>
     <span class="Italics">
      Excretion:
     </span>

Each subject received the following treatments on separate occasions: a single 600-mg dose of abacavir, 0.7 g per kg ethanol (equivalent to 5 alcoholic drinks), and abacavir 600 mg plus 0.7 g per kg ethanol.

     Abacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue. Abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite, carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP), an analogue of deoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate (dGTP). CBV-TP inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA.

     <span class="Bold">
      Antiviral Activity
     </span>
     <br/>
     The antiviral activity of abacavir against HIV-1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including primary monocytes/macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). EC
     <span class="Sub">

     </span>
     values ranged from 3.7 to 5.8 μM (1 microM = 0.28 mcg per mL) and 0.07 to 1 microM against HIV-1

     , respectively, and the mean EC
     <span class="Sub">
      50
     </span>
     value was 0.26 ± 0.18 microM against 8 clinical isolates. The median EC
     <span class="Sub">
      50
     </span>
     values of abacavir were 344 nM (range: 14.8 to 676 nM), 16.9 nM (range: 5.9 to 27.9 nM), 8.1 nM (range: 1.5 to 16.7 nM), 356 nM (range: 35.7 to 396 nM), 105 nM (range: 28.1 to 168 nM), 47.6 nM (range: 5.2 to 200 nM), 51.4 nM (range: 7.1 to 177 nM), and 282 nM (range: 22.4 to 598 nM) against HIV-1 clades A-G and group O viruses (n = 3 except n = 2 for clade B), respectively. The EC
     <span class="Sub">
      50
     </span>
     values against HIV-2 isolates (n = 4), ranged from 0.024 to 0.49 microM. The antiviral activity of abacavir in cell culture was not antagonized when combined with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, zalcitabine or zidovudine, the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) nevirapine, or the protease inhibitor (PI) amprenavir. Ribavirin (50 microM) used in the treatment of chronic HCV infection had no effect on the anti–HIV-1 activity of abacavir in cell culture.

      Resistance
     </span>
     <br/>
     HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to abacavir have been selected in cell culture. Genotypic analysis of isolates selected in cell culture and recovered from abacavir-treated subjects demonstrated that amino acid substitutions K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V/I emerged in HIV-1 RT. M184V or I substitutions resulted in an approximately 2-fold decrease in susceptibility to abacavir. Substitutions K65R, L74M, or Y115F with M184V or I conferred a 7- to 8-fold reduction in abacavir susceptibility, and combinations of three substitutions were required to confer more than an 8-fold reduction in susceptibility.
     <br/>
     Thirty-nine percent (7 of 18) of the isolates from subjects who experienced virologic failure in the abacavir once-daily arm had a greater than 2.5-fold mean decrease in abacavir susceptibility with a median-fold decrease of 1.3 (range 0.5 to 11) compared with 29% (5 of 17) of the failure isolates in the twice-daily arm with a median-fold decrease of 0.92 (range 0.7 to 13).

     <span class="Bold">
      Cross-Resistance
     </span>
     <br/>
     Cross-resistance has been observed among NRTIs. Isolates containing abacavir resistance-associated substitutions, namely, K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V, exhibited cross-resistance to didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, and tenofovir in cell culture and in subjects. An increasing number of thymidine analogue mutation substitutions (TAMs: M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, K219E/R/H/Q/N) is associated with a progressive reduction in abacavir susceptibility.

     In subjects with baseline viral load greater than 100,000 copies per mL, percentages of subjects with HIV-1 RNA levels less than 50 copies per mL were 31% in the group receiving abacavir versus 45% in the group receiving indinavir.
     <br/>
     Through Week 48, an overall mean increase in CD4+ cell count of about 150 cells per mm3 was observed in both treatment arms. Through Week 48, 9 subjects (3.4%) in the group receiving abacavir (6 CDC classification C events and 3 deaths) and 3 subjects (1.5%) in the group receiving indinavir (2 CDC classification C events and 1 death) experienced clinical disease progression.
     <br/>
     CNA30021 was an international, multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial in which 770 HIV-1-infected, therapy-naive adults were randomized and received either abacavir 600 mg once daily or abacavir 300 mg twice daily, both in combination with lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily. The double-blind treatment duration was at least 48 weeks. Trial participants had a mean age of 37 years; were male (81%), white (54%), black (27%), and American Hispanic (15%). The median baseline CD4+ cell count was 262 cells per mm

     (range: 21 to 918 cells per mm

     ARROW (COL105677) was a 5-year randomized, multicenter trial which evaluated multiple aspects of clinical management of HIV-1 infection in pediatric subjects. HIV-1–infected, treatment-naive subjects aged 3 months to 17 years were enrolled and treated with a first-line regimen containing abacavir and lamivudine, dosed twice daily according to World Health Organization recommendations. After a minimum of 36 weeks of treatment, subjects were given the option to participate in Randomization 3 of the ARROW trial, comparing the safety and efficacy of once-daily dosing with twice-daily dosing of abacavir and lamivudine, in combination with a third antiretroviral drug, for an additional 96 weeks. Of the 1,206 original ARROW subjects, 669 participated in Randomization 3. Virologic suppression was not a requirement for participation at baseline for Randomization 3 (following a minimum of 36 weeks of twice-daily treatment), 75% of subjects in the twice-daily cohort were virologically suppressed compared with 71% of subjects in the once-daily cohort.

     The proportions of subjects with HIV-1 RNA less than 80 copies per mL through 96 weeks are shown in Table 11. The differences between virologic responses in the two treatment arms were comparable across baseline characteristics for gender and age.

    <p>
     abacavir tablets and other abacavir-containing products. Your risk of this allergic reaction is much
    </p>
    <p>
     higher if you have a gene variation called HLA-B*5701. Your healthcare provider can determine with a
    </p>
    <p>
     blood test if you have this gene variation.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you get a s ymptom from 2 or more of the following groups while taking abacavir tablets , call

    </p>
    <p>
     What is abacavir tablet?
    </p>
    <p>
     Abacavir tablet is a prescription HIV-1 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1) medicine used with
    </p>
    <p>
     other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 is the virus that causes Acquired Immune
    </p>
    <p>
     Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
    </p>
    <p>
     The safety and effectiveness of abacavir has not been established in children under 3 months of age.
    </p>
    <p>
     When us ed with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1 infection, abacavir tablet may help:
    </p>
    <p>
     • reduce the amount of HIV-1 in your blood. This is called ''viral load''.
    </p>
    <p>
     • increase the number of CD4+ (T) cells in your blood, that help fight off other infections.
    </p>
    <p>
     Reducing the amount of HIV-1 and increasing the CD4+ (T) cells in your blood may help improve your
    </p>
    <p>
     immune system. This may reduce your risk of death or getting infections that can happen when your
    </p>
    <p>
     immune system is weak (opportunistic infections).
    </p>
    <p>
     Abacavir tablets does not cure HIV-1 infection or AIDS. You must keep taking HIV-1 medicines to
    </p>
    <p>
     control HIV-1 infection and decrease HIV-related illnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
