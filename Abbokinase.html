     Precautions while using Abbokinase
    </h2>
    <p>
     Urokinase can cause bleeding that usually is not serious. However, serious bleeding may occur in some people.
     <i>
      To help prevent serious bleeding, carefully follow any instructions given by your doctor. Move around as little as possible, and do not get out of bed on your own, unless your doctor tells you it is all right to do so
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Watch for any bleeding or oozing on your skin, such as around the place of injection or where blood was drawn from your arm. Also, check for blood in your urine or bowel movements. If you have any bleeding or injuries, tell your doctor or nurse right away.
