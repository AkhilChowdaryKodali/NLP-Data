     Uses for Abreva
    </h2>
    <p>
     Docosanol belongs to the family of medicines called antivirals. Antivirals are used to treat infections caused by viruses. Usually they work for only one kind or group of virus infections.
    </p>
    <p>
     Topical docosanol is used to treat the symptoms of herpes simplex virus infections around the mouth. Although topical docosanol will not cure herpes simplex, it may help relieve the pain and discomfort and may help the sores (if any) heal faster.
    </p>
    <p>
     Docosanol is available over the counter.
    </p>
    <h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">
     Before using Abreva
    </h2>
    <p>
     In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:
    </p>
    <h3>
     Allergies
    </h3>
    <p>
     Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Pediatric
    </h3>
    <p>
     Although there is no specific information comparing use of docosanol in children with use in other age groups , this medicine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Geriatric
    </h3>
    <p>
     Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of docosanol in the elderly with use in other age groups.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Interactions with medicines
    </h3>
    <p>
     Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol
    </h3>
    <p>
     Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.

    </p>
    <p>
     Apply the medication to the sores (blisters); rub in gently and completely.
    </p>
    <p>
     To help clear up your herpes infection, continue using docosanol for the full time of treatment. Do not miss any doses. However, do not use this medicine more often or for a longer time than your health care professional or the OTC label indicates.
    </p>
    <h3>
